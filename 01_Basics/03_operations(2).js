// if we give string first operation will be treated as string only and  if number vice- versa  
// instead use parenthesis and write clean code

//If used postfix, with operator after operand (for example, x++), the increment operator increments and returns the value before incrementing.

//If used prefix, with operator before operand (for example, ++x), the increment operator increments and returns the value after incrementing.
